However, the initial energizing effects might not be conducive to sleep for everyone.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Cannabinoid Content:</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>THC:</strong> Killer A5 Haze is noted for having THC levels that can reach up to 30%, which is at the upper limit of what cannabis plants can produce. This high THC content is responsible for its potent effects.</li>\n        <li><strong>CBD:</strong> The strain generally contains low levels of CBD, typically around 0-1%, which means it leans heavily towards psychoactive effects rather than the more balanced or CBD-dominant strains.</li>\n        <li><strong>Other Cannabinoids:</strong> Information on other cannabinoids like CBG or THCV in Killer A5 Haze is less common in web sources, but there's an indication of trace amounts of CBG, which could offer additional anti-inflammatory benefits, and THCV, which might provide some focus and energy. However, exact percentages are not widely reported.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>This information reflects the strain's profile based on available online data, which can vary due to cultivation conditions, phenotype expression, and testing methods. Remember, individual experiences with cannabis can vary greatly, and medical use should be discussed with a healthcare provider.</p>",
